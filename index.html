        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Mohith, a passionate Computer Science Engineering (CSE) student currently exploring the world of technology and innovation. I am deeply interested in ethical hacking, network security, and automation. I love learning about new technologies, solving complex problems, and continuously improving my skills.

I believe that technology has the power to transform lives, and my goal is to master it in every way possible. Whether it’s penetration testing, coding, or exploring the fascinating world of AI, I’m always excited to learn and take on new challenges.

When I’m not coding or diving into security topics, you’ll likely find me experimenting with new tools, learning something new, or creating innovative projects. I'm dedicated to building a career that will not only help me grow but also contribute positively to the tech community.

Feel free to explore my website and check out my projects. I’m always open to feedback and collaboration opportunities!</p>
